## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open the website**: Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
2. **For GitHub Pages**: Push all files to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages

## 📸 Adding Images

The website currently uses SVG placeholder images. To add real photos:

1. Download high-quality travel images (recommended: 1200x800px or larger)
2. Save them in the `assets/` folder with these exact names:
   - `bali.jpg`
   - `tokyo.jpg`
   - `swiss-alps.jpg`
   - `iceland.jpg`
   - `morocco.jpg`
   - `cambodia.jpg`

**Search terms:**

## 📱 QR Code Placement
